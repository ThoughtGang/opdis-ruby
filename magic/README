				 Magic

A Ruby C extension (and gem) for the libmagic library and database used by
the file(1) command.

BUILD
-----

The standard C extension build process is used:

	bash# ruby extconf.rb
	bash# make

Note that the Ruby headers must be installed. On Ubuntu, these are in the
ruby-dev or ruby1.9-dev package.


The gem is built using the standard gem build command:

	bash# gem build Magic.gemspec


The top-level Makefile supports each of these builds with the commands
'make' and 'make gem'.

	bash# make
	# builds C extension
	bash# make gem
	# builds the gem



EXAMPLES

Extended examples are provided in the 'examples' directory. The following
code snippets give a brief overview of using the BFD and Opcodes extensions
together.

require 'Magic'
File.open( '/tmp/a.out' ) { |f| puts Magic::identify(f) }

File.open( '/tmp/a.out' ) { |f| puts Magic::identify(f, {:mime => true}) }

Magic.identify( '<html></html>' )

Magic.identify( [0x7f, 0x45, 0x4c, 0x00] )
