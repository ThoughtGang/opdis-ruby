			  	Ptrace

A Ruby C extension (and gem) for the POSIX ptrace facility.


BUILD
-----

The standard C extension build process is used:

	bash# ruby extconf.rb
	bash# make

Note that the Ruby headers must be installed. On Ubuntu, these are in the
ruby-dev or ruby1.9-dev package.


The gem is built using the standard gem build command:

	bash# gem build Ptrace.gemspec


The top-level Makefile supports each of these builds with the commands
'make' and 'make gem'.

	bash# make
	# builds C extension
	bash# make gem
	# builds the gem



EXAMPLES

Extended examples are provided in the 'examples' directory. The following
