Gem for the GNU Binutils libopcodes library.

iBINUTILS AND SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES
The implementation of binutils (and libopcodes) does not provide a way to 
determine the supported platforms at compile time, unless the config.h file 
used to build the binutils package is present.

The extconf.rb file has been modified in order to detect the architectures
supported by the local copy of binutils, and to allow the user to specify
which architectures they want supported.

It does this using the following steps:

	1. run objdump -i to get the supported architectures
	2. each line that matches one of binutils' known architectures is
           added as a #define to CPPFLAGS
	3. if no architectures have been found, or if objdump failed to run,
	   default to the i386 architecture.

The binary used in step 1 can be specified by the user via the --with-objdump
flag. For example:

	bash# cat /tmp/objdump.sh
	#/bin/sh
	echo 'arm'
	echo 'sparc'
	echo 'm68k'
	bash# ruby1.9 extconf.rb --with-objdump=/tmp/objdump.sh
        checking for init_disassemble_info() in -lopcodes... yes
        Adding architecture 'arm'
        Adding architecture 'sparc'
        Adding architecture 'm68k'
        creating Makefile

This makes it possible to force compilation of support for specific 
architectures when there is no working objdump present. Note that libopcodes
must have been compiled with support for the architectures, or you will get
runtime errors.
