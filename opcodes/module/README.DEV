The Opcodes module is used as a lightweight version of opdis to test 
interaction with binutils in general and libopcodes in particular.

Code which is developed for the Opcodes extension will be copied into
the Opdis extension, where it will be maintained separately.

When the extensions are stable, this redundancy needs to be removed. A top-level
shared dir will contain the redundant code, which will be referenced in the
gemspecs. NOTE: this may break the gem builds.
