			  BFD (Binary File Descriptor)

A Ruby C extension (and gem) for the GNU Binutils libbfd library.

Note: this is not a complete implementation of the BFD API; it is only
intended for use with the Opcodes or Opdis Ruby extensions.

BUILD
-----

The standard C extension build process is used:

	bash# ruby1.9 extconf.rb
	bash# make

Note that the Ruby headers must be installed. On Ubuntu, these are in the
ruby-dev or ruby1.9-dev package.


The gem is built using the standard gem build command:

	bash# gem build Opcodes.gemspec


The top-level Makefile supports each of these builds with the commands
'make' and 'make gem'.

	bash# make
	# builds C extension
	bash# make gem
	# builds the gem


RUBY 1.8 SUPPORT

...is not available. Attempts to backport the 1.9 extension to 1.8 resulted
in the 1.8 interpreter aborting whenever an instance variable was accessed.

Any user of 1.8 is welcome to submit a patch which provides 1.8 support
without breaking 1.9 support.


EXAMPLES

Extended examples are provided in the 'examples' directory. The following
code snippets give a brief overview of using the BFD extension.

require 'BFD'

t = Bfd::Target.new('/tmp/a.out')
t.symbols.values.each { |sym| puts sym }

Bfd::Target.new('/tmp/a.out') do |tgt|
	tgt.sections.each { |name, sec| puts sec }
end
