= Opdis Callback Routines

== Summary

libopdis uses callback functions to override its default behavior. The
OpdisExt extension provides stubs that allow Ruby objects to be used
for these callbacks.

module Opdis

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
=begin rdoc
An object responsible for filling an Opdis::Instruction object based on the
output of libopcodes.
=end
  class InstructionDecoder

=begin rdoc
Fill an Opdis::Instruction object based on the information supplied by
libopcodes.

The <i>insn</i> argument is an Opdis::Instruction object to be filled by this 
method. Depending on the InstructionDecoder object, it may have been 
partially filled by a previous Decoder (e.g. the GenericDecoder and one of the
X86Decoders).

The <i>hash</i> argument contains the output of libopcodes and has the following
members:

:vma:: The virtual memory address of the instruction.
:offset:: The offset of the instruction into the target buffer.
:size:: The size of the instruction in bytes.
:buffer:: An array containing the bytes in the instruction.
:items:: An array of the instruction strings generated by libopcodes.
:raw_insn:: The complete instruction string (ASCII_ as generated by libopcodes. 
:branch_delay:: The number of instructions that will execute before the branch
takes effect. 
This is not always set by libopcodes.
:data_size:: The size of the data reference in the instruction. 
This is not always set by libopcodes.
:type:: The type of the instruction (e.g. non-branch, branch type, etc).
This is not always set by libopcodes.
:target:: The target address of a branch or dereference.
This is not always set by libopcodes.
:target2:: The second target address of a branch or dereference.
This is not always set by libopcodes.

InstructionDecoder#decode will invoke opdis_default_decoder to fill
architecture-independent members such as Instruction#vma and Instruction#ascii.

The return value of this method is ignored.

A decoder for disassembled AT&T syntax x86 instructions.

See InstructionDecoder#decode.
This will invoke opdis default x86 decoder with Intel syntax.

An object for determining whether an address has been encountered.

This is used to prevent endless loops in control-flow analysis.

An object for determine the VMA referred to by the target operand of a
branch instruction, if possible.

Return nil if address cannot be resolved
